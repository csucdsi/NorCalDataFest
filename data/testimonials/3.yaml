text: "DataFest was an awesome, eye-opening experience. It was my first real encounter with big data, and it was not only, of course, challenging, but rewarding as well. Being a stats major I usually work with other stats majors, but DataFest gave me the opportunity to work with people with other majors, such as Business, Computer Science, etc. Because of this, it opened me up to different programs/applications that I have never used before. All in all, I definitely recommend DataFest to anyone and I would attend again!"
