text: "Iâ€™m currently pursuing a degree in Applied Mathematics and before DataFest I was unsure of what I wanted to do. Thanks to this experience I have discovered a field I did not know existed. Being able to use programs such as R to work with real world data and finding something really significant was really fascinating. Data mining for hours with a team consisting of different majors was pretty cool, but finally finding the pot of gold felt amazing. DataFest was an incredible experience and has also helped me figure out what it is I want to get into after receiving my BS."
