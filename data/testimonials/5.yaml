text: "DataFest gave me valuable experience with working under time-pressure and trying to figure out the best way to approach a problem given the time crunch. I was also given the opportunity to talk to professionals in the data science field who bestowed some insight about what a data science job was like. This event was the first time I had ever had to deal with a dataset this massive and make an attempt to get some interpretation out of it, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Not only did I get a lot of experience from DataFest that I wouldnâ€™t have received in a classroom, I also had a blast all three days. I highly recommend students to participate regardless of their major and hope to see them attending next year!"
