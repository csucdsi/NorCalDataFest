text: "Participating in DataFest was a great way to expose myself to the practical use of data in the real world. Before this, I never really knew how much you could possibly do with data and the many different ways you can analyze it. I think anyone who is interested in data or research should particpate as it was a very rewarding and eye-opening experience!"
