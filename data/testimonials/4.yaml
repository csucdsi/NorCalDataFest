text: "I really enjoyed judging at CSUC's Datafest. I would do it again, and I think it’s important not to have just company sponsors judging but also independent smart engineers. This way, the judges also have a chance to learn from each other. CSUC's Datafast was very well run, and I am willing to support well run Datafests because I think it’s an important way for computer scientists to develop real programming skills."
