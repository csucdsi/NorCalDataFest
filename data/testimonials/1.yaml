text: "Data Fest was so much fun! I'm glad I participated because it gave me a taste of analyzing real data in a time constraining environment. As a biologist, it is useful for me to understand how to clean data, how to analyze it, and how to communicated it to an audience. Data Fest also gave me confidence to work with a team under pressure. I realized that most jobs available will be team oriented, and that makes the 'real world' less scary to work in. I can't wait to tackle a new data set for next year's Data Fest."
